Rectangle problem

Given some points in cartesian coordinate, (X, Y) find the number of rectangles that can be created by those points.
Take into consideration only the rectangles that are parallel with the X, Y axes.

Sample input:
(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)

Sample output:
3

If we modify the sample and remove the (2,3) the output will be: 1

Sample input 2:
(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (3,3)

Sample output 2:
1
